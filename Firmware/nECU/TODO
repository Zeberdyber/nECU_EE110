        [X] Initialized/Working to be standardized
        [ ] Timeout values for program blocks
    [X] EGT.c rewrite
        [ ] fix EGT communication
    [ ] Move test functions to corresponding files
    [X] check _ID_MAX usage
    [X] create printf progress bar
        [ ] Startup progress
    [X] move flow control to new file
        [ ]handle double errors
    [ ] tim PWM out rewrite + OX
    [ ] LED animations unification

[ ] on road:
    [ ] OX calibration
    
[ ] scheduled:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication
    [ ] watchdogs
    [ ] fault detection - set flags for repeted fault
        [ ] add flags
            - igf:
                > missfire
                > no signal
            - SpeedSens:
                > abnormal sensor
                > data error
    [ ] UART
        [ ] trafic indication
        [ ] debug data send
        [ ] sensor data send (variable tracing)

[ ] optimization:
    [ ] Knock sensing (will be done after UART added)

[ ] reverse engeneering:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication type
    [ ] Narrowband oxygen sensing

[ ] TODOs over easter break (easter went by and none was done :-/ ):
    [ ] ABS speed sensors testing
        [ ] loom rewire
    [ ] Immo communication
    [ ] Oil pressure analog input
