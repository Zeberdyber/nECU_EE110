[ ] develop:
    [ ] fault detection - set flags for repeted fault
        [ ] add flags
            - igf:
                > missfire
                > no signal
            - SpeedSens:
                > abnormal sensor
                > data error
    [ ] UART
        [ ] trafic indication
        [ ] debug data send
        [ ] sensor data send (variable tracing)

Current issues:
    IGF signal does not fall to complete zero - no signal edge is detected

[ ] test:
    [ ] hardware test:
        [ ] frequency readout (RPM) fix and test functions - missing level shifter?

[ ] on road:
    [ ] OX calibration
    
[ ] scheduled:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication
    [ ] External AI (analog input) in code integration with proper scaling settings
    [ ] watchdogs

[ ] optimization:
    [ ] Knock sensing (will be done after UART added)

[ ] reverse engeneering:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication type
    [ ] Narrowband oxygen sensing

[ ] TODOs over easter break (easter went by and none was done :-/ ):
    [ ] ABS speed sensors testing
        [ ] loom rewire
    [ ] Immo communication
    [ ] Oil pressure analog input

[ ] Known bugs:
    [ ] ocassional VSS speed readout incorrect (will last for maximum of 1s)
        Happened once so far when slowing down slowly at speed around 12km/h readout bumped to 45km/s for a 600ms period
