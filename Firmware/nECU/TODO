[ ] RPM signal clear mess

[ ] Development
    [ ] OX sensor heater
    [ ] OX sensor analog signal
    [ ] IGF missfire
    [ ] IGF RPM calculation

[ ] Bugs
    [ ] Tacho display bug (occasionnaly value is displayed twice)
    [ ] filtering of VSS (low speed correction)
    [ ] frequency readout (RPM) fix and test functions
    [ ] Buttons sporadic not working, double click faulty

[ ] Optimization
    [ ] Knock sensing (after UART added)

[ ] Scheduled
    [ ] Onboard UART
    [ ] External AI in code integration with proper scaling settings
    [ ] Immobilizer communication

[ ] fault detection (as a seperate file)
    [ ] add flags
        - over temp
        - can:
            > timeout
            > error
            > other?
        - spi:
            > timeout
            > error
            > other?
        - flash:
            > save error
            > erase error
            > read error
            > other?
        - igf:
            > missfire
            > no signal
            > other?
        - buttons:
            > other?
        - egt:
            > data frame error
            > ic over temp
            > sensor error
        - uart:
            > other?
        - VSS:
            > input ripple
            > over speed
            > other?
        - SpeedSens:
            > abnormal sensor
            > data error
    [ ] function skeletons
    [ ] warning when temp high (+ MCU_temperature.upToDate monitoring)

[ ] UART
    [ ] UART variables as a struct
    [ ] UART knock raw data functions labeled
    [ ] UART sending data live


[ ] Tests for each file functions
    [ ] test flash code
    [ ] timer interrupt automatic tests functions

[ ] static flags of initialized

[ ] remove numbers from files "magic numbers"
[ ] maybe dont calculate difference for each watchdog (waste of time),
    calculate once and update all

[ ] timer watchdogs
    [ ] PWM (ox heater, button output)
    [ ] IC (button inputs, ...)

[ ] timer rewrite to reuse functions
    [X] PWM functions
    [ ] IC functions

[ ] use new timer in files
    [ ] stock
    [ ] button

[X] figure out how to import typedefs
[ ] in watchdogs use pointers to timers from starting files

[ ] Onboard LEDs to use non-blocking delay functions
[X] typedefs to nECU.h file
