[ ] develop:
    [X] static flags:
        [X] initialized and working:
            [X] debug
        [X] don't do routines when not working:
            [X] debug
    [ ] fault detection - set flags for repeted fault
        [ ] add flags
            - can:
                > timeout
                > error
                > other?
            - igf:
                > missfire
                > no signal
                > other?
            - buttons:
                > other?
            - VSS:
                > input ripple
                > over speed
            - SpeedSens:
                > abnormal sensor
                > data error    

[ ] test:
    [ ] interrupt changes:
        [ ] button animations (TIM1 interrupt removed, tick track)
    [ ] hardware test:
        [ ] VSS input ripple
        [ ] Tacho display bug (occasionnaly value is displayed twice)
        [ ] filtering of VSS (low speed correction)
        [ ] frequency readout (RPM) fix and test functions
        [ ] Buttons sporadic not working, double click faulty

[ ] scheduled:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication
    [ ] Onboard UART
    [ ] External AI (analog input) in code integration with proper scaling settings
    [ ] watchdogs

[ ] optimization:
    [ ] Knock sensing (will be done after UART added)
