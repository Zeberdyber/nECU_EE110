[ ] develop:
    [ ] Update Bench_mode
    [ ] System diagnostics
        Show all running components, lookup all data, prepare for UART diagnostics
        [X] Initialized/Working to be standardized
        [ ] Timeout values for program blocks
    [ ] fault detection - set flags for repeted fault
        [ ] add flags
            - igf:
                > missfire
                > no signal
            - SpeedSens:
                > abnormal sensor
                > data error
    [ ] UART
        [ ] trafic indication
        [ ] debug data send
        [ ] sensor data send (variable tracing)
    [ ] can.c
        [X] clean up 'checktime' function
        [ ] separate RX buffers and filters for coolant/wheelsetup/rpm data
    [ ] EGT.c rewrite
    [ ] Block initialized/working if function status is error
    [ ] Init/Start/Stop functions
    [ ] Check if function should be called start/init
    [ ] Set status error flag if already initialized & working
    [ ] Set debug status to D_CODE_ERROR on "return" when not working
    [ ] Move test functions to corresponding files
    [ ] Move data processing functions ex: nECU_ADC_expSmooth to data_processing.c (reuse functions)
    [ ] Move "Started"/"Stopped" printf to debug.c
    [ ] Add checking for NULL pointer
    [ ] ADC1/ADC2 - Stop (remember about hard stop on error)
    [ ] Speed sensig rewrite to simplify
    [ ] check _ID_MAX usage
    [ ] create printf progress bar
    [ ] move flow control to new file, handle double errors
    [ ] tim PWM out rewrite + OX

Current issues:
    IGF signal does not fall to complete zero - no signal edge is detected

[ ] test:
    [ ] hardware test:
        [ ] frequency readout (RPM) fix and test functions - missing level shifter?

[ ] on road:
    [ ] OX calibration
    [X] rectify 'IdleUp' missing -> resolution: missing 'initialized = true'
    
[ ] scheduled:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication
    [ ] watchdogs

[ ] optimization:
    [ ] Knock sensing (will be done after UART added)

[ ] reverse engeneering:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication type
    [ ] Narrowband oxygen sensing

[ ] TODOs over easter break (easter went by and none was done :-/ ):
    [ ] ABS speed sensors testing
        [ ] loom rewire
    [ ] Immo communication
    [ ] Oil pressure analog input

[ ] Known bugs:
    [ ] ocassional VSS speed readout incorrect (will last for maximum of 1s)
        Happened once so far when slowing down slowly at speed around 12km/h readout bumped to 45km/s for a 600ms period
