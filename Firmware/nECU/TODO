[ ] develop:
    [ ] fault detection - set flags for repeted fault
        [ ] add flags
            - igf:
                > missfire
                > no signal
            - VSS:
                (NO) input ripple
            - SpeedSens:
                > abnormal sensor
                > data error
    [X] VSS filterring for stable data output - currently high ripple
        done with additional buffer, updated on CAN frame send

Current issues:
    IGF signal does not fall to complete zero - no signal edge is detected
    VSS output signal is about right although very messy

[ ] test:
    [ ] hardware test:
        [X] VSS input ripple - no tipple
        [X] filtering of VSS (low speed correction)
        [ ] frequency readout (RPM) fix and test functions - missing level shifter?
    [X] user settings saving (from button menu) - working :D
    [ ] Add pull down resistor (370R) and test IGF signal

[ ] on road:
    [ ] OX calibration
    [ ] VSS calibration
    
[ ] scheduled:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication
    [ ] Onboard UART
    [ ] External AI (analog input) in code integration with proper scaling settings
    [ ] watchdogs

[ ] optimization:
    [ ] Knock sensing (will be done after UART added)

[ ] reverse engeneering:
    [ ] Immobilizer communication type
    [ ] Narrowband oxygen sensing

[ ] TODOs over easter break (easter went by and none was done :-/ ):
    [ ] ABS speed sensors testing
        [ ] loom rewire
    [ ] Immo communication
    [ ] Oil pressure analog input

[X] Tests on bench:
    [X] IGF interrupts
    [X] IGF calculation
    [X] VSS interrupts
    [X] VSS calculation
