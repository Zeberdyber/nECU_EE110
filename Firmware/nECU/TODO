    [ ] fault detection - set flags for repeted fault
        [ ] add flags
            - can:
                > timeout
                > error
                > other?
            - igf:

                > no signal
                > other?
            - buttons:

[ ] test:
    [ ] interrupt changes:
        [X] knock sampling (TIM8 interrupt removed)
        [X] knock regression (TIM11 deleted, tick track)
        [X] CAN message timing (TIM6 and TIM7 deleted, tick track)
        [ ] button animations (TIM1 interrupt removed, tick track)
    [ ] hardware test:
        [ ] VSS input ripple
        [X] EGT retest after new functions added (SPI as interrupt and new que)
        [ ] Tacho display bug (occasionnaly value is displayed twice)
        [ ] filtering of VSS (low speed correction)
        [ ] frequency readout (RPM) fix and test functions
        [ ] Buttons sporadic not working, double click faulty

[ ] optimization:
    [ ] Knock sensing (will be done after UART added)

[ ] scheduled:
    [ ] Onboard UART
    [ ] External AI (analog input) in code integration with proper scaling settings
    [ ] Immobilizer communication
