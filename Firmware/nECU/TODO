[ ] missing code
    [ ] missfire detection
    [ ] IGF functionality

[X] ADC1 longer buffer (limit callbacks)
[X] automatic ADC DMA buffer averaging

[ ] code refactor
    [-] calculate ADC full conversion times, write them to ADC file as a note
        - Macro done to adjust dma buffer length to needs
    [ ] update files to match repo description
    [X] EGT SPI functions to nECU_spi file with proper communication buffering

[ ] fault detection (as a seperate file)
    [ ] add flags
        - over temp
        - can:
            > timeout
            > error
            > other?
        - spi:
            > timeout
            > error
            > other?
        - flash:
            > save error
            > erase error
            > read error
            > other?
        - igf:
            > missfire
            > no signal
            > other?
        - buttons:
            > other?
        - egt:
            > data frame error
            > ic over temp
            > sensor error
        - uart:
            > other?
        - VSS:
            > input ripple
            > over speed
            > other?
        - SpeedSens:
            > abnormal sensor
            > data error
